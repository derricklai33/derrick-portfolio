                    <h2>Hi there, My name is Derrick!</h2>
                    <p>I am currently a student developer completing a <strong>Diploma of I.T</strong> at <a href="https://coderacademy.edu.au/">Coder Academy</a> based in Melbourne, Australia to become a <strong>full stack developer</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Before this, I have been working in retail, while undertaking my <strong>Bachelor of Engineering</strong> degree for about 4 years now. I graduated back in 2018 and found the field of work was not what I was expecting going into it. </p>
                    <p>I am extremely passionate in coding and always loved the aspect of coding during my bacherlor degree.</p>
                    <p>Also, I am a big volleyball fan! I have been playing since my university days and heavily involved with RMIT volleyball club, holding a committee member position as a secretary! And the picture up top is the team that we won gold with!!</p>
                    <p>I am extremely excited to see how my coding journey will pan out in the future and only hunger for the endless <del>debugging</del> <ins>knowledge</ins> that web development has to offer!</p>
